📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

📌 Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining an existing customer is often more cost-effective than acquiring a new one.
This project analyzes customer data from a telecommunications provider to identify patterns, key drivers, and predictors of churn using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and machine learning models.

🎯 Objectives
Understand churn patterns in telecom customers.

Identify important features influencing churn.

Build data pipelines for preprocessing and analysis.

Develop predictive models to estimate churn probability.

Provide business insights to help reduce churn rates.

📂 Dataset
Source: [Telco Customer Churn dataset (IBM)] or other available telecom datasets

Size: ~7000 customer records

Features:

Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)

Customer account info (tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, total charges)

Services subscribed (phone, internet, streaming TV, streaming movies)

Target variable: Churn (Yes or No)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost (or Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Notebook Environment: Jupyter(VScode)

📈 Project Workflow
1.Data Loading & Cleaning

Handle missing values

Convert data types (e.g., TotalCharges to numeric)

Encode categorical variables

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize churn distribution

Compare churn vs non-churn customer metrics

Correlation heatmaps, box plots, count plots

3.Feature Engineering

Create new features from existing data

Normalize/scale values

One-hot encoding for categorical variables

3.Model Building & Evaluation

Train/test split

Model selection: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

4.Insights & Recommendations

Key drivers of churn

Suggested retention strategies

📊 Sample Insights
Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.

Customers with fiber-optic internet service are more likely to churn compared to DSL.

Electronic check method users churn more than automatic bank transfer users.

Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to leave.

📌 Business Recommendations
Offer incentives for long-term contracts.

Improve service quality for high-churn segments.

Target at-risk customers with personalized retention campaigns.
